# Analysis of Covid-19 Dataset using R
This project is an analysis of the Covid-19 dataset using R programming language. The Covid-19 dataset has been widely used by researchers and analysts to track the spread of the pandemic and its impact on different countries and regions.
In this analysis, we aim to provide insights into the Covid-19 dataset, such as the trends in the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, as well as the factors that may have contributed to the spread of the virus.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the Covid-19 data repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University  which is updated daily with the latest data on the Covid-19 pandemic from around the world.

## Tools Used
- RStudio 

## Packages Used
- tidyverse
- lubridate
- ggplot2
- Analysis
### The analysis has been divided into the following sections:
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Modeling

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
The Covid-19 dataset is provided in a time-series format, with each row representing the number of cases and deaths for a particular country on a particular date. Before we can begin our analysis, we need to clean and prepare the data.
In this section, we will perform the following tasks:
- Load the dataset into R.
- Rename the columns to more meaningful names.
- Convert the date column to a date format.
- Group the data by country and date.
- Calculate the number of new cases and deaths per day.
- Remove any missing or inconsistent data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In this section, we will use various visualization techniques to explore the Covid-19 dataset and gain insights into the following:
1. The trends in the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
2. The countries and regions most affected by the pandemic.
3. The factors that may have contributed to the spread of the virus.

## Modeling
In this section, we will use regression analysis to model the factors that may have contributed to the spread of the Covid-19 virus. We will focus on the following independent variables:
1. Population density
2. GDP per capita
3. Health expenditure per capita
4. Age distribution
We will use the number of confirmed cases per capita as the dependent variable.

## Conclusion
The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, affecting millions of people and causing widespread economic and social disruption. In this analysis, we have used R to explore the Covid-19 dataset and gain insights into the trends and factors that may have contributed to the spread of the virus.
Our analysis has shown that the number of confirmed cases and deaths has varied widely between different countries and regions, and that factors such as population density, GDP per capita, health expenditure per capita, and age distribution may have played a role in the spread of the virus.
Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of these factors on the Covid-19 pandemic, and to develop effective strategies for mitigating the spread of the virus in the future.
